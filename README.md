Description
---------------------

A prototype multiplayer browser based shoot 'em up I decided to make to get familiar with some of the newest web technologies.
I used the GLGE library for the WebGL rendering, node.js on the server, and socket.io for the websockets. 


**Future Plans**
Reduce bandwidth consumption
Chat
Game Modes (Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Survial)
AI (for Survival)
More weapons 

Try It
--------------------

WASD moves your cube, aim and shoot with the mouse.

**Note:**
Still in heavy development. 
Uses a lot of bandwidth.
LAN play should be ok. 
Works best with Google Chrome.

**Dependencies**
Node.js
npm express, socket.io, bison

Change the serverip variable in index.html and start the server with node app.js, Default port is 3000.
