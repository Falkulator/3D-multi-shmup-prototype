Remove an unneeded goto in the decompressor; it turns out that the
state of ip_ after decompression (or attempted decompresion) is
completely irrelevant, so we don't need the trailer.

Performance is, as expected, mostly flat -- there's a curious ~3–5%
loss in the “lsp” test, but that test case is so short it is hard to say
anything definitive about why (most likely, it's some sort of
unrelated effect).

Speed up decompression by caching ip_.

It is seemingly hard for the compiler to understand that ip_, the current input
pointer into the compressed data stream, can not alias on anything else, and
thus using it directly will incur memory traffic as it cannot be kept in a
register. The code already knew about this and cached it into a local
variable, but since Step() only decoded one tag, it had to move ip_ back into
place between every tag. This seems to have cost us a significant amount of
performance, so changing Step() into a function that decodes as much as it can
before it saves ip_ back and returns. (Note that Step() was already inlined,
so it is not the manual inlining that buys the performance here.)

The wins are about 3–6% for Core 2, 6–13% on Core i7 and 5–12% on Opteron
(for plain array-to-array decompression, in 64-bit opt mode).

There is a tiny difference in the behavior here; if an invalid literal is
encountered (ie., the writer refuses the Append() operation), ip_ will now
point to the byte past the tag byte, instead of where the literal was
originally thought to end. However, we don't use ip_ for anything after
DecompressAllTags() has returned, so this should not change external behavior
in any way.

Microbenchmark results for Core i7, 64-bit (Opteron results are similar):

properly cases where gettimeofday() can stand return the same

and put a lower bound on the number of iterations -- the same
amount as we use to calibrate.

We should probably use CLOCK_MONOTONIC for platforms that support
it, to be robust against clock adjustments; we already use Windows'
monotonic timers. However, that's for a later changelist.

Include C bindings of Snappy, contributed by Martin Gieseking.

I've made a few changes since Martin's version; mostly style nits, but also
a semantic change -- most functions that return bool in the C++ version now
return an enum, to better match typical C (and zlib) semantics.

I've kept the copyright notice, since Martin is obviously the author here;
he has signed the contributor license agreement, though, so this should not
hinder Google's use in the future.

We'll need to update the libtool version number to match the added interface,
but as of http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html
I'm going to wait until public release.
